# Exercice 4:

* url: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types

Go predecalres certain type names. Other are introduced with type declaration or type parameter lists. 
Composite types - arrays, structs, functions, interfaces, slices, maps, and channels - may be defined using type literals.

##  Exercise

1. Create you own type. Have the underlying type (Tipo subyacente, ra√≠z o implicito) be an int.
2. Create a VARIABLE of your new TYPE with the IDENTIFIER "x" using the "VAR" keyword
3. In func main
    1. print out the value of the variable "x"
    2. print out the type of the variable "x"
    3. assign 42 to the VARIABLE "x" using the "=" OPERATOR
    4. print out the value of the variable "x"
